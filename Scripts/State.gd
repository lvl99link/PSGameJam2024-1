# NOTE
# This is a virtual class template for State objects. You do NOT write logic in this script.
# You create a new script for each State you want to implement and extend this class.
# Then overwrite any of the below virtual functions in THAT script.

# Virtual function. Receives events from the `_unhandled_input()` callback.
func handle_input(_event: InputEvent) -> void:

# Virtual function. Corresponds to the `_process()` callback.
func update(_delta: float) -> void:
	pass

# Virtual function. Corresponds to the `_physics_process()` callback.
func physics_update(_delta: float) -> void:
	pass

# Virtual function. Called by the state machine upon changing the active state. The `msg` parameter
# is a dictionary with arbitrary data the state can use to initialize itself.
func enter(_msg := {}) -> void:
	pass

# Virtual function. Called by the state machine before changing the active state. Use this function
# to clean up the state.
